```js
let iceCreamTaste = "chocolate";
let iceCreamDensity = 10;

while (iceCreamDensity > 0) {
  console.log("Drip...");
  iceCreamDensity -= 1;
}

console.log("The " + iceCreamTaste + " ice cream melted.");
```

`ice_cream_taste` and `ice_cream_density` should be in `camelCase` to conform with JavaScript variable naming conventions.

We should end our lines with semicolons.

Correct spacing in our while loop as well as the console.log.

Correct indenting.
