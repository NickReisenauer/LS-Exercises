The problem with the code was our `if` block conditional. We initially closed off the condition argument before we accessed the `&&` so anything after the closing parenthesis would have been invalid syntax because it wasn't contained in our conditional and it wasn't in the `if` block.

```js
let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if (currentSpeed > speedLimit && currentSpeed - speedLimit > 5) {
  console.log(
    '"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
      "that computers don't have to be that good to be much better.\" " +
      "-- Marc Andreessen"
  );
}
```
