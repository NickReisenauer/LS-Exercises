According to MDN, the `getYear()` method returns the year in the specified date according to local time. Because `getYear()` does not return full years ("year 2000 problem"), it is no longer used and has been replaced by the `getFullYear()` method.

The `getFullYear()` method returns the year of the specified date according to local time.

```js
let today = new Date();

today.getYear(); // 120
today.getFullYear(); // 2020
```
