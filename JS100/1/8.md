## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  3 variables

- Output:
  String (typeof the 3 variables)

- Rules / Requirements:
  We are given three variables each containing different values or expressions.
  Our job is to evaluate what typeof will return when called with each variable.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Is this all in chronological order?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let tweet = "I'm learning to program! Woooot :-) #javascript #launchschool";
let words = tweet.split(" ");
let isValid = tweet.length < 140;

typeof tweet;
typeof words;
typeof isValid;
```

## Data Structures

- Variables

  > Input

- String
  > Output

## Algorithm

Seeing as the first variable, I am assuming that typeof will return string.
Seeing that the second variable is the first string variable with the `split` method called on it with a space character as the delimiter argument, I know that split will return an array so I am assuming the typeof operator will return object.
Seeing as the third variable uses a comparison operator to evaluate two values, I think that 'boolean' will be returned.

## Code

```txt
string
object
boolean
```

## Official Solution

```js
typeof tweet; // 'string'
typeof words; // 'object'
typeof isValid; // 'boolean'
```

Note in particular that although `words` is an array, `typeof words` returns `'object'`. This is because, in JavaScript, arrays are a kind of objects. If you need to specifically distinguish whether an object is an array, you can use the `Array.isArray()` method, which returns a Boolean:

```js
Array.isArray(words); // true
```
