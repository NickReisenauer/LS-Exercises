## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array

- Output:
  String

- Rules / Requirements:

  - Locate the documentation for the `Array` built-in object on MDN.
  - How can we access the element `'and'` in the array `['fish', 'and', 'chips']`?

- Clarifying Questions:
  - Can we use Array bracket notation?
  - Are we supposed to leave the original array as is, or modify it in some way?
  - Are we supposed to store the value into a variable?
  - Is there always going to be at least 3 elements in the array?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
// Get 'and' out and store it into a variable
```

## Data Structures

- Array

- String

## Algorithm

For this task, I am going to probably use array bracket notation to access elements using an index. Since arrays are zero based indexes, instead of using the second index, we need to actually use the first index. So something like `arr[1]` which will access the middle in the given array.

## Code

```js
let arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
let middle = arr[0];
```

## Official Solution

```js
["fish", "and", "chips"][1];
```

Or:

```js
let dinner = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
dinner[1];
```

See [the MDN page on Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

We can use bracket notation to access the array element at a particular index. In JavaScript, arrays have a zero-based index. This means that the first element in the array will have an index of 0, the second element will have an index of 1, and so on.
