## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:

  - What happens if we take the array `['fish', 'and', 'chips']` and try to access the element at index position `10`? Try this in your JavaScript console.

- Clarifying Questions:
  - Assuming there is less elements in the array than 10?
  - Are we allowed to look up rules related to accessing properties that don't exist in arrays.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
arr[10];

// ??
```

## Data Structures

- Array

  > Input

- Unknown/TBD
  > Output

## Algorithm

If I remember reading correctly, without looking it up, accessing array elements that do not exist will always return `undefined`. I am going to say that `undefined` will be returned from trying to access `[10]` on the given array.

## Code

```js
let arr = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
console.log(arr[10]);
// Undefined
```

The return value was indeed `undefined`.

## Official Solution

Attempting to access an element at an index that is out of the bounds of the array will return `undefined`.

```js
["fish", "and", "chips"][10]; // => undefined
```
