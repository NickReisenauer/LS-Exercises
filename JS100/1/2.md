## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String

- Output:
  String

- Rules / Requirements:
  Find out whether JavaScript has a method to lowercase a string, for example converting `'Aloha, World!'` into `'aloha, world!`.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Is this a Google search type of question
  Can we use MDN
  Can we use a REPL

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
'Aloha, World!'
// Into
'aloha, world!
```

## Data Structures

- String
  > Input
- String
  > Output

## Algorithm

I am going to Google search for a method that can convert a JS string into a lowercase only string. I will primarily use links from MDN if available.

## Code

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase

```js
let lowercase = "Aloha, World!".toLowerCase();
```

## Official Solution

### Solution

[The method `String.prototype.toLowerCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) converts a string into lowercase.

```js
"Aloha, World!".toLowerCase(); // 'aloha, world!'
```

### Discussion

You might notice that there is an additional [method `String.prototype.toLocalLowerCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleLowerCase), which is relevant for alphabets in which the case mapping is not as straightforward as in English. But as long as we don't work with a language where this is the case, `toLowerCase()` is the straightforward choice.
