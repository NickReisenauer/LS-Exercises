## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  None

- Output:
  while loop

- Rules / Requirements:
  Write a `while` loop that logs all odd natural numbers between 1 & 40.

- Clarifying Questions:
  What's your definition of a natural number?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
// 1
// 3
// 5
// ...
```

## Data Structures

- while loop

  > Body

- Numbers
  > Being logged

## Algorithm

Create an index variable and initialize it to 0.
Create a while loop and set the condition to be `i < 40`.
In the body of our while loop, create an if statement with a condition of `i & 2 === 0` to check if the number is odd or even.
If the number is odd, log it using console.log.
If the number is even, do nothing.
The last thing in our while loop is to increment the index variable by 1.

## Code

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 40) {
  if (i % 2 !== 0) console.log(i);
  i += 1;
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
let num = 1;

while (num < 40) {
  console.log(num);
  num += 2;
}
```

You might have come up with code like the following:

```js
let num = 1;

while (num <= 40) {
  if (num % 2 !== 0) {
    console.log(num);
  }

  num += 1;
}
```

It loops over all numbers from 1 to 40 and uses an `if` statement to determine whether or not `num` should be logged. In order to check whether `num` is even, we would use the condition `num % 2 === 0`, which checks whether `num` is divisible by 2 without remainder. In order to determine whether a number is odd, we simply negate it.

The trick in our solution code is that we know that each second number is odd, so if we start at 1, we can simply increment the number by 2 on each iterating, effectively looping only over the odd numbers.
