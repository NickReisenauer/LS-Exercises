## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  array

- Output:
  console.log

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given an array of numbers and a index, create a while loop that can log out each element in the array and stop looping when there are no more elements.
  Has to be a while loop, and use the provided `index` variable.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let index = 0;

// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

## Data Structures

- Array
  > Input
- Number
  > Index
- Loop
  > loop

## Algorithm

Create a while loop that's stopping condition is `index < array.length` and inside the while loop, log out `array[index]`. During each iteration, increment the index variable by 1 so that we do not run into an infinite loop.

## Code

```js
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let index = 0;
while (index < array.length) {
  console.log(array[index]);
  index += 1;
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let index = 0;

while (index < array.length) {
  console.log(array[index]);
  index += 1;
}
```

On line 5, we access the array element at the current index, and log the returned element to the console with `console.log`. Subsequently, we increment `index` by 1.

After each iteration of the loop, our `while` condition is evaluated. Since JavaScript arrays have a zero-based index, we want to terminate the loop when `index` is equal to `array.length`, because the last index of an array is always *one less* than the array's length.
