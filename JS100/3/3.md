## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  null

- Output:
  string / loop

- Rules / Requirements:
  Write a loop that logs a predefined greeting x amount of times.

- Clarifying Questions:
  - Can this be any type of loop?
  - Can I use a `count` variable instead of hard coding the loop length?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let greeting = "Aloha!";
// Aloha
// Aloha
// Aloha
```

## Data Structures

- String

  > Message

- Number
  > Loop length

## Algorithm

Create a variable `x` that will store the amount of times we need the loop to run.
Create a `message` variable that will hold our message to be logged.
Create a for loop that will run `x` amount of times.
For each iteration, log out `message`.

## Code

```js
let message = "Aloha!";
let x = 5;
for (let i = 0; i < x; i += 1) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

## Official Solution

Using a `for` loop:

```js
let greeting = "Aloha!";

for (let count = 1; count <= 3; count += 1) {
  console.log(greeting);
}
```

Using a `while` loop:

```js
let greeting = "Aloha!";
let count = 1;

while (count <= 3) {
  console.log(greeting);
  count += 1;
}
```

For both kinds of loops, we declare a counter variable `count` to keep track of how many iterations we've been through. We start by assigning it to 1, and then increment it on each iteration of the loop. As soon as it is greater than 3, the condition provided to the loop returns `false` and the loop is terminated.
