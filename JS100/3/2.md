## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Loop

- Output:
  Logs 10 down to one then logs 'Launch!'

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a for loop, change it to log 10 to 1 in decreasing order, and after it logs 1 it will log `Launch!`

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Data Structures

- for loop

  > Input

- console.log
  > Output

## Algorithm

We have a for loop that currently counts from 1 to 10, and we need it to count downwards from ten until one. To do that all we have to do is initialize `i` to be equal to 10, set our condition to be 1 >= 1, and finally our increment operator to be `i -= 1`. Once we've done that, we can set up an if statement to check if `i` is equal to 1 and if it is, then we just log out the string launch.

## Code

```js
for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 1) console.log("Launch!");
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
}

console.log("Launch!");
```

In our solution code, we initialize `i` to 10, and decrement `i` by 1 on each iteration, using the short-hand expression `i -= 1`. Once `i` is equal to 0, the condition provided to our `for` loop is false and the loop terminates. Finally, we log `'Launch!'`.

There are different ways to achieve this behavior. For example, you could also use `i >= 0` as condition and then check whether `i` reached the value of 0 inside the loop, in order to determine whether to log the number or `'Launch!'`.

```js
for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
  if (i === 0) {
    console.log("Launch!");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```
