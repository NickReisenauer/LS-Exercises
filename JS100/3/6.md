## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  (string | null)[]

- Output:
  void

  > console.log

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given an array, write a for loop that logs out the city name if there is one. Some elements are null and if there is a null in the loop, use the `continue` keyword to skip it.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let cities = [
  "Istanbul",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Tokyo",
  null,
  "Vienna",
  null,
  "London",
  "Beijing",
  null,
];

// Istanbul
// ...
```

## Data Structures

- Array of strings | null

  > Input

- for loop

  > Body

- console.logs
  > Output

## Algorithm

Create a for loop that has an initialValue of 0, a condition of `i < arr.length`, and an incrementExpression of `i += 1`. Inside the for loop, write an `if` statement that is going to check if the `array[i]` is a truthy value or not. If not, use continue to skip iteration, if it is a truthy value, log it to the console.

## Code

```js
let cities = [
  "Istanbul",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Tokyo",
  null,
  "Vienna",
  null,
  "London",
  "Beijing",
  null,
];
for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i += 1) {
  if (!cities[i]) continue;
  console.log(cities[i]);
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
let cities = [
  "Istanbul",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Tokyo",
  null,
  "Vienna",
  null,
  "London",
  "Beijing",
  null,
];

for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i += 1) {
  if (cities[i] === null) {
    continue;
  }

  console.log(cities[i].length);
}
```

`continue` terminates the current iteration and continues with execution of the next iteration. This allows us to skip each element that is equal to `null`.
