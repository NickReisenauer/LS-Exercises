## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  string[]

- Output:
  console.log

- Rules / Requirements:
  We are given an array of strings, we need to log out each one until we find `nemo`. Once we find `nemo` we are to log it, and then immediately terminate the loop.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Can we use the break statement?
  Can we use any type of loop?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let fish = ["Dory", "Marlin", "Gill", "Nemo", "Bruce"];
// ...
// 'Gill'
// 'Nemo'
```

## Data Structures

- array
  > Input
- string
  > input
- loop
  > body

## Algorithm

Create a for loop with an initialValue of 0, a condition of `i < fish.length`, and an incrementExpression of `i += 1`.
Inside of the for loop, create an `if` statement to check if the current element is equal to 'nemo', if it is, log it out and then break out of the loop, otherwise nothing.

## Code

```js
let fish = ["Dory", "Marlin", "Gill", "Nemo", "Bruce"];
for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(fish[i]);
  if (fish[i] === "Nemo") break;
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
let fish = ["Dory", "Marlin", "Gill", "Nemo", "Bruce"];

for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(fish[i]);

  if (fish[i] === "Nemo") {
    break;
  }
}
```

When iterating over an array, it is a common pattern to loop over all indices in the array and access the elements one by one using the current index.

Because arrays are zero-indexed, there are two points that require care: The start index needs to be 0. And you need to terminate before you reach `fish.length`, because the last index is `fish.length - 1`.
