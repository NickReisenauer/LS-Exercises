## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  for loop

- Output:
  for loop

- Rules / Requirements:
  We are given a for loop that results in an infinite loop, our job is to fix it so that it does not result in an infinite loop. We need it to run one time and then stop.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}

// "and on"
// "and on"
// "and on"
// ... forever
```

## Data Structures

- for loop
  > input / output

## Algorithm

Add a conditional statement to stop loop execution when conditional is met. Without this conditional statement as our second argument, we run into an infinite loop. According to the requirements, we should stop after the first iteration so our condition is `i < 1`. We could also use the break statement after our console.log.

## Code

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}
```

## Official Solution

The above code never terminates, because the condition of the `for` loop was left empty. In this case, JavaScript treats it as `true`.

One way to terminate the loop from within the body is to use [the `break` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break):

```js
for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
  break;
}
```

Note that `continue` does not help here, as it would simply forward us to the next iteration.
