## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  for loop

- Output:
  console.log() // undefined

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a sample for loop, log out the current value of `i` as well as write out what you think the logs will produce

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  // include your code here
}
```

## Data Structures

- for loop

  > Input

- Number
  > Being logged from inside the loop

## Algorithm

On the first iteration of the for loop, our `i` variable is whatever we initially set it as.
On the next iteration, `i` will be whatever `i` was before plus whatever the increment operator added to it. In our case this is 2 per iteration.
The code will stop running when `i` is less than or equal to 10.

To log out all these values from inside, we can just add a `console.log` call inside the loop and add `i` so that it is logged on each iteration.
Our code should log `10`, this is because in our stopping condition, we have a greater than or equals to comparison operator, so `i` will at one point be 10 which is still truthy thus we are able to complete one more loop and log 10.

## Code

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

// 0
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
```

## Official Solution

Recall that the general syntactical structure of a `for` loop looks like this:

```js
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {
  statement;
}
```

The `initialExpression` initially assigns `i` to 0. Then, on each iteration of the `for` loop, `i` is re-assigned via the `incrementExpression`. The expression `i += 2` in our loop is short-hand for `i = i + 2`, and thus re-assigns `i` to the current value of `i` plus 2. When the value of `i` is greater than 10, the `condition` provided to our `for` loop is no longer true and the loop terminates.
