## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  string

- Output:
  number

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the length of a given string.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Is this supposed to be a function or do we just provide a number?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
"These aren't the droids you're looking for.";

```

## Data Structures

- String
  > Input
- Number
  > Output

## Algorithm

We can use the `.length` property to determine the length of a given string.

## Code

```js
"These aren't the droids you're looking for.".length;
// => 43
```

## Official Solution

```js
let string = "These aren't the droids you're looking for.";

string.length; // 43
```

We can determine the length of a string using the `length` property. An empty string will have a length of 0.
