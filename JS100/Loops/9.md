To terminate our loop right after finding `Nemo` we just write an `if` statement to check if the current string is equal to `Nemo` and if it is we can `break` out of the loop.

```js
let fish = ["Dory", "Marlin", "Gill", "Nemo", "Bruce"];
for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(fish[i]);
  if (fish[i] === "Nemo") break;
}
```
