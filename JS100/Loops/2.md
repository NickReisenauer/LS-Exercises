Instead of incrementing `i`, we can start at 10 and decrement `i`. We just need to change our stopping condition to stop if `i` is less than or equal to 1 and decrement `i` by one each time. To log `launch` at the end, just add an `if` check to see if the index is equal to 1 and if so `console.log(launch)`.

```js
for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 1) console.log("Launch");
}
```
