The reason the loop keeps going forever is because we didn't add a stopping condition. In a `for` loop, we add our stopping condition as the second argument. If we don't, `i` will just keep incrementing and cause an infinite loop of `console.logs`. We can also stop our loop with a `break` statement.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}
```
