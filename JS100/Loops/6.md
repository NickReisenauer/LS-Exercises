`continue` lets us terminate execution of our current loop and skip to the next loop. We can put our `continue` in an `if` statement to check a condition and skip the current iteration of the loop if the condition is true.

```js
let cities = [
  "Istanbul",
  "Los Angeles",
  "Tokyo",
  null,
  "Vienna",
  null,
  "London",
  "Beijing",
  null,
];

for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i += 1) {
  if (cities[i] === null) continue;
  console.log(cities[i].length);
}
```
