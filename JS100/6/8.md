## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);
```

## Data Structures

- variable
- function
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

This code will output `2` to the console. This is because we have a parameter named `a` but we pass in `2` as an argument so `a` in the function becomes `2` because we passed in `b` as our parameter.

## Code

```js
2;
```

## Official Solution

The code logs `2`.

This is another example of *variable shadowing*: The parameter `a` of `myFunction` shadows the variable `a` declared on line 1. The `a` we reference within the function body, on line 4, therefore refers to whatever argument is passed to the function, in our case the value of `b`, which is then logged.
