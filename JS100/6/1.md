- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```

## Data Structures

- variable / console.log
  > Input

## Algorithm

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of scope, but their initial value is undefined until JS reaches the line of code in which they are initialized a value.

## Code

```js
=> undefined;
```

## Official Solution

The code logs `undefined`.

All variables in JavaScript declared with `var` are hoisted, meaning they are virtually moved to the beginning of the scope. This means that our code snippet above behaves like the following one:

```js
var greeting;

console.log(greeting);

greeting = "Hello world!";
```

When a `var` variable is declared but not assigned a value, like on line 1, it is initialized to the value `undefined`. For that reason, the code logs `undefined` to the console.
