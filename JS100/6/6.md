## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);
```

## Data Structures

- variables
- if conditional
- boolean
- numbers
- console.log
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

This code will log `false` because the if statement expression will evaluate to true and the new `b` variable that is declared inside the if statement will be scoped inside of the if statement and will not affect the b variable that is declared at the top of the snippet.

## Code

```js
false;
```

## Official Solution

The code logs `false`.

The situation is similar to that of the previous exercise: The variable `b` declared on line 2 and the variable `b` declared on line 5 in the body of the `if` statement have the same name, but they are two different variables. Important to note is that the `b` that we reference on line 8 refers to the variable declared on line 2. This is because the scope of `b` declared on line 5 is the body of the `if` statement, and it is not accessible in any outer scope.
