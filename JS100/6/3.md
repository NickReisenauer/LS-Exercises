## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue);
```

## Data Structures

- if statement
- variable
  > Body

## Algorithm

We are declaring our let variable inside the if statement which means that it is not accessible from outside the if statement. When we try to log it out we are going to get a ReferenceError saying that myValue is not defined.

## Code

```js
ReferenceError: myValue is not defined.
```

## Official Solution

```js
ReferenceError: myValue is not defined
```

Variables declared with `let` are block scoped. This means that when we declare the variable `myValue` within a block on line 2, that variable is not accessible outside of the block on line 5, and a `ReferenceError` is raised.
