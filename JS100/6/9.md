## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
const a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  a = 2;
}

myFunction(a);
```

## Data Structures

- const variable
- function
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

This code won't log anything to the console and will throw an error. This is because we are trying to reassign a constant variable to a new value which is not allowed.

## Code

```js
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Official Solution

```js
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

Variables declared by `const` are block scoped, similar to variables declared by `let`, but their value cannot be changed through re-assignment. So when we try to re-assign `a` to a new value on line 4, we get an error.

Note that passing `a` as an argument to `myFunction` on line 7 has no effect, as the function does not declare any parameters. It is an excess argument that is simply ignored in the function body.
