## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
const a = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

function myFunction() {
  a.firstName = "Jane";
}

myFunction();

console.log(a);
```

## Data Structures

- object
- function
- console.log
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

This code will log out { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }. The reason that we can change the const a object is because we can change what is stored in the object we just can't change the actual reference to the object (e.g reassignment).

## Code

```js
{ firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }
```

## Official Solution

```js
{ firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" }
```

The fact that `const` variables cannot be re-assigned does not mean that the value they hold is immutable. As we see in the example above, objects that are assigned to `const` variables can be mutated.

One way to make an object immutable is by means of [the `Object.freeze()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze). But it's important to note that this is a shallow freeze, meaning it only applies to the immediate properties of the object. If the value of those properties are objects themselves, they can still be mutated.
