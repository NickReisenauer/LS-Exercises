## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
console.log(greeting);

let greeting = "Hello world!";
```

## Data Structures

- variable
  > Input

## Algorithm

`let` variables are not hoisted so this will throw a ReferenceError.

## Code

```js
ReferenceError;
```

---

---

## Official Solution

```js
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
```

In contrast to `var` variables, `let` variables are not accessible before they are declared. For that reason the above code raises an error.
