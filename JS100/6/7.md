## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Determine the output of the given code snippet.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  console.log(a);
}

myFunction();
```

## Data Structures

- variable
- function
- console.log
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

This code will log `1` to the console because `a` is globally scoped and thus can be accessed directly from within the function.

## Code

```js
1;
```

---

---

## Official Solution

The code logs `1`.

The variable `a` declared in the `let` statement on line 1 is declared at the very top level of our code, so it is accessible from everywhere in the code, including from within the body of `myFunction`.
