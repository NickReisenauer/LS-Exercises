## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  randomNumber variable

- Output:
  yes | no

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given the same randomNumber variable as last exercise, we need to use a ternary operator instead of an if statement to log out either yes or no depending on if the number is 1 or 0.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
1; // Yes!
0; // No.
```

## Data Structures

- number
  > randomNumber variable
- console.log
  > Output

## Algorithm

The ternary operator evaluates a variable and if it's true it will execute whatever is following the ? otherwise, if it's false whatever is after the : will be evaluated.

## Code

```js
let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

randomNumber ? console.log("Yes!") : console.log("No.");
```

## Official Solution

```js
let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

console.log(randomNumber ? "Yes!" : "No.");
```

The syntactical structure of [the ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) is like so:

```js
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

If the condition provided is truthy, `expression1` will be evaluated. If the condition is falsy, `expression2` will be evaluated.

You may have come up with a solution like the following:

```js
randomNumber ? console.log("Yes!") : console.log("No.");
```

This is a perfectly fine solution. Ours is an alternative that uses the ternary operator only to decide on the string that is going to be logged. Take a close look at it: The expression `randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No.'` evaluates to either the string `'Yes!'` or the string `'No.'`. Since it is an expression that evaluates to a string value, we can use it as an argument to `console.log`. It's similar to using other complex expressions with operators, as in `console.log('Hello' + 'World')`.
