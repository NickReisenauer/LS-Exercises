## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output
  String

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a code snippet, determine what the output is going to be.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
if (true && false) {
  console.log("Yes!");
} else {
  console.log("No...");
}
```

## Data Structures

- if statement
  > Input
- String
  > Output

## Algorithm

We have to think about the functionality and return value of the logical AND operator.
The logical AND requires both sides of the expression to be truthy for it to be truthy, otherwise it's falsy. This code will output 'No...' because there's a false in the logical and which will make it evaluate to falsy in the if conditional.

## Code

```js
"No...";

```

## Official Solution

The output will always be `'No...'`.

The condition provided to our `if` statement uses the *logical and* operator `&&`. Therefore the condition will return a truthy value only if *both* of its operands are truthy. Since `false` is not truthy, neither will be our condition.
