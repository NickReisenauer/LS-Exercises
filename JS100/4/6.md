## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  none

- Output:
  switch statement

- Rules / Requirements:
  Same as last exercise, except this time rewrite the weather statements to use a switch case.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

none

## Data Structures

- String
  > Input
- Switch case
  > Body
- String
  > Output

## Algorithm

Create a variable called weather that will store the weather string.
Create a switch case with 2 cases and a default case using the same strings as last time.
Be sure to add a default case to prevent any fall through.

## Code

```js
let weather = "sunny";
switch (weather) {
  case "sunny":
    console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
    break;
  case "rainy":
    console.log("Grab your umbrella.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}
```

## Official Solution

```js
switch (weather) {
  case "sunny":
    console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
    break;
  case "rainy":
    console.log("Grab your umbrella.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}
```

Our `switch` statement evaluates the provided expression, `weather`, and when it finds a `case` clause matching the value of that expression, the code within that `case` clause is executed. If the value of the provided expression does not match any `case` clause, the `default` clause is executed.
