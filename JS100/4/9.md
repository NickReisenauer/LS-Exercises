## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a ternary operator and a variable containing a boolean, determine what the output will be.
  Do this without running the code.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let sale = true;
let admissionPrice = !sale ? 5.25 : 3.99;

console.log("$" + admissionPrice);
```

## Data Structures

- Boolean
  > Variable
- Ternary Operator
  > Input
- console.log
  > Output

## Algorithm

In the admissionPrice variable, we are using the logical not operator to swap the truthiness of our `sale` variable. Previously it was true, now it will be false because we negated it.
This causes our admission price ternary expression to be 3.99.

## Code

```js
"$3.99";

```

## Official Solution

```txt
$3.99
```

On line 2 of our code, `admissionPrice` is assigned to the value of the ternary *if-then-else* statement. Note that `sale` was assigned to `true` on line 1, and the condition in the ternary statement prepends this with the *logical not* operator `!`. The *logical not* operator returns `false` when its operand (in our case `sale`) is truthy. The condition that is checked is therefore false, and thus `admissionPrice` is assigned to the value of the second operand (`3.99`) of our ternary statement.
