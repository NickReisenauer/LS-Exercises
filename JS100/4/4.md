## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  string

- Output:
  string

- Rules / Requirements:
  Create a weather variable that stores a string value representing the weather.
  If the weather is sunny log out it's a beautiful day
  If the weather is rainy log out grab your umbrella
  Otherwise, log out let's stay inside

- Clarifying Questions:
  What if we are provided with a different string value for the weather?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
weather = 'sunny' => "it's a beautiful day"
weather = 'rainy' => "grab your umbrella"
weather = 'dusty' => "Let's stay inside"
```

## Data Structures

- string
  > Input
- string
  > Output
- if statement
  > body logic

## Algorithm

Create a weather variable that is going to hold a string containing the weather type.
Then create an if statement that checks if the weather variable is equal to 'sunny', and if it is, then log out "It's a beautiful day!".
Then create an else if statement that checks if the weather variable is equal to 'rainy', and if it is then log out "Grab your umbrella.".
Finally, create an else statement that just logs out "Let's stay inside."

## Code

```js
let weather = "rainy";
if (weather === "sunny") console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
else if (weather === "rainy") console.log("Grab your umbrella.");
else console.log("Let's stay inside.");
```

## Official Solution

```js
let weather = "snow storm"; // 'sunny', 'rainy', ...

if (weather === "sunny") {
  console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
} else if (weather === "rainy") {
  console.log("Grab your umbrella.");
} else {
  console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}
```

Note that we used the strict equality operator, `===`, to determine if `weather` was `'sunny'` or `'rainy'`. If both of these comparisons return `false`, the `else` branch of our `if` statement will be executed.
