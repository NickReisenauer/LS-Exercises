## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  String

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a code snippet, evaluate what the output is going to be.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
if (false || true) {
  console.log("Yes!");
} else {
  console.log("No...");
}
```

## Data Structures

- if statement
  > Body
- Strings
  > Output

## Algorithm

Just think about the return value and functionality of the logical or operator.
This should evaluate to true because the logical or operator only requires one truthy value for the whole expression to be evaluated to true.

## Code

```js
"Yes!";

```

## Official Solution

The output will always be `'Yes!'`.

The condition provided to our `if` statement uses the *logical or* operator `||`. Therefore the condition will evaluate to a truthy value if *either one* of its operands is truthy. Since `true` is truthy, the condition will always be truthy as well.
