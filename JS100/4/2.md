## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  randomNumber variable (either 1 or 0)

- Output:
  string

- Rules / Requirements:
  `randomNumber` will be initialized to either 1 or 0. If it's 1 then log out yes otherwise log out no.
  `randomNumber` will be provided and will always equal either 1 or 0 exactly.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Is this a function or just an if statement?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());
1; // Yes
0; // No
```

## Data Structures

- number

  > Random Number input

- if statement
  > Conditional logging

## Algorithm

Falsy values include 0, so all we have to do is write an if statement that's conditional is just passed the `randomNumber` variable and if it's 1 then it will evaluate to truthy, it the number is 0, then it will evaluate to falsy. We can add an else in the case that it's falsy.

## Code

```js
let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());
if (randomNumber) console.log("Yes!");
else console.log("No.");
```

## Official Solution

```js
let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

if (randomNumber) {
  console.log("Yes!");
} else {
  console.log("No");
}
```

Recall that that `0` is [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) in Javascript, while `1` is truthy. Our `if` statement will execute the code on line 4 if the condition provided on line 3 (`randomNumber`) is truthy; otherwise it will execute the code on line 6.

Alternatively, you could have used as conditions `if (randomNumber === 0)` and `if (randomNumber === 1)`. Just remember to make it a habit to use strict equality `===`.

If you are unfamiliar with `Math.round()` and `Math.random()`, take a few moments to check out MDN's documentation of the `Math` object.
