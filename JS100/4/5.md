## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  switch case

- Output:
  console.logs

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a switch case, we need to determine what this switch case will log out.
  Refer to the MDN page to learn about switch statements.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let animal = "horse";

switch (animal) {
  case "duck":
    console.log("quack");
  case "squirrel":
    console.log("nook nook");
  case "horse":
    console.log("neigh");
  case "bird":
    console.log("tweet tweet");
  default:
    console.log("*cricket*");
}
```

## Data Structures

- switch case
  > Input
- console.logs
  > switch case output

## Algorithm

The switch case needs to have a break statement at the end of each case otherwise there will be a "fall through" and it will execute the case it matches and everything up until the end of the switch statement or a break statement.

## Code

Here's the following log statements:

```js
"neigh";
"tweet tweet";
"*crickets*";

```

## Official Solution

Because the value of `animal` is `'horse'`, the following is logged to the console:

```txt
neigh
tweet tweet
*cricket*
```

The `switch` statement evaluates the provided expression (`animal` in our case) and will execute the statement associated with the case that matches, *as well as the statements in all cases following the matching case* until reaching either the end of the `switch` statement or a `break`.

In the provided code, this means that after finding a matching case (`'horse'`), JavaScript will execute `console.log('neigh')` as well as the `console.log` invocations in all following clauses.

In order to avoid this "fall through" behavior, we can place a `break` statement in each clause of our `switch` statement, as seen below:

```js
let animal = "horse";

switch (animal) {
  case "duck":
    console.log("quack");
    break;
  case "horse":
    console.log("neigh");
    break;
  case "bird":
    console.log("tweet tweet");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("*crickets*");
}
```
