## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Numbers

- Output:
  Boolean

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given 3 number variables, determine the output of the logical && expression.
  There are a few comparison operators as well as a logical OR operator.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let speed = 0;
let acceleration = 24;
let brakingForce = 19;

let isMoving = brakingForce < acceleration && (speed > 0 || acceleration > 0);

console.log(isMoving);
```

## Data Structures

- Logical &&
- Logical ||

## Algorithm

Both sides of the logical && operator have to evaluate to a truthy value for the expression to evaluate truthy.
Starting from left to right comparison, we have 19 < 24 which is true, and on the right we have a sub expression with ||, so the sub expression will evaluate to true if one side passes, which the right side does.
Acceleration is a truthy value and the logical || evaluated to true so both sides of the && are true meaning it evaluates to true.

## Code

```js
true;
```

## Official Solution

The code outputs `true`.

**Bonus question:** Yes, we do need the parentheses, because `&&` has a higher [operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) than `||`, so:

```js
(brakingForce < acceleration && speed > 0) || acceleration > 0;
```

is equivalent to:

```js
(brakingForce < acceleration && speed > 0) || acceleration > 0;
```

The provided code uses the *logical or* operator `||`, which checks whether *at least one* of its operands is truthy, and the *logical and* operator `&&`, which checks whether *both* its operands are truthy.

In the above code, the operands are comparisons with the following values:

```js
brakingForce < acceleration; // true
speed > 0; // false
acceleration > 0; // true
```

Therefore, our logical expression breaks down to `true && (false || true)`. Since `false || true` evaluates to `true` and `true && true` evaluates to `true` as well, the value of `isMoving` is `true`.
