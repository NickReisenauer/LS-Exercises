Instead of using a `switch` statement to log out a predefined set of human/cat years, we can create a for loop that will add the extra amount on the first and second indexes and return the correct total for any number input into the function.

```js
const catAge = (x) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < x; i += 1) {
    if (i === 0) total += 11; // only 11 because we add 4 at the bottom of every loop
    if (i === 1) total += 5; // only 5 for the same reason
    total += 4;
  }
  return total;
};
```
