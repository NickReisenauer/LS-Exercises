The code snippet will log `true`. If we take the parenthesis first, we get a truthy value, and the left side of the `&&` evaluates to true as well so we have two truthy values which makes the `&&` truthy. For the bonus question: we would need parenthesis because of operator precedence with `&&` and `||`.
