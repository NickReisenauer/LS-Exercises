We can use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to determine what we should log out based on what the string is.

```js
let weather = "rainy";

if (weather === "sunny") console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
else if (weather === "rainy") console.log("Grab your umbrella");
else console.log("Let's stay inside");
```
