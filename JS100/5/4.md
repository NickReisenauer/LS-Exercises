## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Number

- Output:
  Number

- Rules / Requirements:
  Create a function called `squaredNumber` that takes one number argument, `num` and returns the argument squared (multiplied against itself).

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
squaredNumber(3); // 9
squaredNumber(8); // 64
```

## Data Structures

- Number
  > Input / Output

## Algorithm

Create a function called `squaredNumber` that takes one argument called `num` which is a number. Using arrow function implicit return, return the result of the number being multiplied by itself.

## Code

```js
const squaredNumber = (num) => num * num;
```

## Official Solution

```js
function squaredNumber(num) {
  return num ** 2;
}
```

Our solution uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to multiply our parameter `num` by the power of 2. Because squaring a number is the equivalent of multiplying the number by itself, the below solution would also be valid:

```js
function squaredNumber(num) {
  return num * num;
}
```

Note that in order to *return* the squared number from our function we must use an explicit `return` statement. Otherwise, the return value of our function `squaredNumber` would be `undefined`.
