## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  string

- Output:
  string

- Rules / Requirements:
  Use JS string methods to transform 'Captain Ruby' to 'Captain JavaScript'.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Can we use the .split method?
  Do we have to use strictly string instance methods or any methods that can work with strings?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
'Captain Ruby'
=> 'Captain JavaScript'
```

## Data Structures

- string
  > Input / Output

## Algorithm

Using the split method, split the string using a space character delimiter, and return the first index of the split array and concatenate on JavaScript with a space between the words.

## Code

```js
"Captain Ruby".split(" ")[0] + " JavaScript";
```

## Official Solution

```js
"Captain Ruby".replace("Ruby", "JavaScript");
```

There is more than one way to achieve this. Arguably the most straightforward one is to use the `String.prototype.replace()` method. Another possibility is to extract the first part of the input string, `'Captain'`, and concatenate it with `'JavaScript'`. For example:

```js
"Captain Ruby".substring(0, 8) + "JavaScript";
```

Or:

```js
"Captain Ruby".split(" ")[0] + " JavaScript";
```

It is often the case that there is more than one way to achieve some result. Exploring different ways makes you more familiar with the language and can give you insights into possible trade-offs. Ultimately, we advise you to choose the solution that is easiest to understand.
