## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Code snippet

- Output:
  TBD

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given a code snippet, determine what it will output to the console when it's run.

- Clarifying Questions:
  None

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
function multiplesOfThree() {
  let divisor = 1;

  for (let dividend = 3; dividend <= 30; dividend += 3) {
    console.log(dividend + " / " + divisor + " = 3");
    divisor += 1;
  }
}

multiplesOfThree;
```

## Data Structures

- for loop
  > Input / Body

## Algorithm

First of all the function that is written is not being called so nothing will happen and nothing will be logged.
If we were to call the function, we would just be calculating some division problems.

## Code

```js
// nothing
```

## Official Solution

There will be no output, because the function `multiplesOfThree` is not invoked.

To invoke the function, we should append parentheses to the function name on line 10, like so:

```js
multiplesOfThree();

// logs:
// 3 / 1 = 3
// 6 / 2 = 3
// 9 / 3 = 3
// ...
```
