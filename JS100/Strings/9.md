We can split each word of the string into an array with `split` and then capitalize the first index of each word in the array and then join the capital with the rest of the word.

```js
const str = "launch school tech & talk".split(" ").map((word) => {
  return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
});
```
