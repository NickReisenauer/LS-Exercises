## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  SyntaxError

- Output:
  Find the error

- Rules / Requirements:
  We are given a code snippet that, when run, throws a SyntaxError. Our job is to find out where this error is originating and why.

- Clarifying Questions:
  - Can we run the code before we submit our final solution?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if (currentSpeed > speedLimit) && ((currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5) {
  console.log('"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
    'that computers don\'t have to be that good to be much better." ' +
    '-- Marc Andreessen');
}
```

## Data Structures

## Algorithm

Looking at this code snippet, I can tell that there's in issue after our if statement's parenthesis. We should have our curly brace directly after the if parenthesis. The && is what is throwing the error and that's because JS doesn't expect that to be in that location. If we wanted to include the additional check we would need to add an additional set of parenthesis into our if statement.

## Code

```js
let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if (currentSpeed > speedLimit && currentSpeed - speedLimit > 5) {
  console.log(
    '"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
      "that computers don't have to be that good to be much better.\" " +
      "-- Marc Andreessen"
  );
}
```

## Official Solution

[This page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Unexpected_token) provides information about the exact error that our code raised. The error message indicates that "a specific language construct was expected, but something else was provided". It even hints at typical causes, like leaving out brackets around `if` statements, which is what happened in our code.

```js
let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if (currentSpeed > speedLimit && currentSpeed - speedLimit > 5) {
  console.log(
    '"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
      "that computers don't have to be that good to be much better.\" " +
      "-- Marc Andreessen"
  );
}
```

[The MDN reference on JavaScript errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) lists many errors that you will run into as you write more code. If you're unsure why you're seeing a particular error, pause and check out the documentation.
