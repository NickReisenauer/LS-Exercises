- Rules / Requirements:
  Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out which result the expression `4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10` evaluates to.
  Use MDN to find the operator precedence page.

> Input / Output

## Algorithm

`**` has an operator precedence of 16
`/` has an operator precedence of 15
`*` has an operator precedence of 15
`+` has an operator precedence of 14

Higher number has higher precedence.
Otherwise, these operators operate from left to right.

```js
4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10

4 * 5 + 9 / 10

20 + 9 / 10

20 + 0.9

=> 20.9
```

## Official Solution

The MDN [page on operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) in JavaScript includes a table that tells us that the order of the arithmetic operator used in the expression above is as follows:

`**` > (`*` and `/`) > `+`

This means that when using parentheses for grouping, the expression is equivalent to `(4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10)`, and therefore evaluates to `20.9`.

Although operator precedence makes an expression like `4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10` unambiguous for the JavaScript engine, using parentheses usually makes an expression with multiple operators much easier for humans to read. For clarity, you should always use the parentheses when mixing operators, e.g.,

```js
4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10;
```

Don't assume that somebody working on your code knows the precise precedence rules.
