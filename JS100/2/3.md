## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Task

- Output:
  Number

- Rules / Requirements:
  Using the documentation, determine how we can find the largest numeric value that can be represented in JavaScript. Write a line of code that returns this value.

- Clarifying Questions:
  We can use MDN?

## Examples / Test Cases

Max numeric value that JS can represent.

## Data Structures

- Number:

## Algorithm

Because we are allowed to use the documentation, I am going to start by looking at the `Number` documentation on MDN. If we look there, there is a property available on Number called MAX_SAFE_INTEGER that should provide us with what we need. There is also MAX_VALUE which is the largest that JS can possibly represent but it's too large for JS to even work with.

## Code

```js
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
// 9007199254740991

console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE);
// 1.7976931348623157e+308
```

## Official Solution

```js
Number.MAX_VALUE; // 1.7976931348623157e+308
```

`MAX_VALUE` is a [property of `Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_VALUE). Any value larger than `MAX_VALUE` should be processed as `Infinity`.

The value `1.79...e+308` uses [exponential notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) and can be read as `1.79... * 10^308` (1.79... times 10 to the power of 308), which is short-hand for a really large number.

In ES6, another value was introduced: [`MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). It has a value of 9007199254740991 and is the largest number that can be processed and compared with precision.

However, it is unlikely you will need those values soon.
