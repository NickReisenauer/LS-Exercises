## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Date.now()

- Output:
  TBD / Unknown

- Rules / Requirements:
  Find out what `Date.now()` returns.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Can we use MDN?

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
Date.now();
// ??
```

## Data Structures

- Date object
  > Input

## Algorithm

Looking at MDN, Date.now returns a Number representing the milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.

## Code

```js
let time = Date.now();
console.log(time);
// 1614893348637
```

## Official Solution

Quoting [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now):

> The `Date.now()` method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

For example:

```js
console.log(Date.now()); // 1536562500455
```

This way of representing a point in time is called [*Unix time* or *epoch milliseconds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). Chances are high that you will encounter and use Unix time quite a few times throughout your future career. Check out [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2001/09/unix-tick-tocks-to-a-billion/) if you want to read a bit more about it.

The Date documentation on MDN provides a lot of good information about `Date` objects and how to work with them. Take some time to explore this information and familiarize yourself with the methods available to you.
