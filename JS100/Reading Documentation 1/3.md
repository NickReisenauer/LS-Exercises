There is no method for this.

If we wanted to implement an uppercase method we could take the string and find the character with the index of 0 and capitalize that letter. Then we can add the original string minus the first letter with `string.slice`.

```js
const string = "mountain";
const uppercase = string[0].toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
```
