```js
"8" == 8; // true
"8" === 8; // false
```

Line 1 is `true`. This is because the equality operator (`==`) coerces values when comparing. If we compare two items of different types, say a string and a number, it will try and convert the string into a number.

Line 2 is `false`. This is because the strict equality operator (`===`) doesn't try to coerce values and just compares them as they are. If we compare a string and a number they are not going to be equal so it will return false.
