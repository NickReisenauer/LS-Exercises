In line `3` we are accessing the last element in the trees array. We can do this with the .length property which returns the length of the array but it's not zero based so we have to subtract one to get the last element.

In line `4` we are using the `pop()` method to remove the last element of the array. `pop()` will return the element that it removed. This method permanently changes the array.

In line `5` we access the last element again, but instead of returning "palm tree" like last time it will return "sequoia". This is because we used `pop()` on line 4 to permanently remove the last element of the array.

```js
let trees = ["birch", "pine", "sequoia", "palm tree"];

trees[trees.length - 1]; // palm tree
trees.pop(); // palm tree
trees[trees.length - 1]; // sequoia
```
