```js
let tweet = "Starting to get the hang of it... #javascript #launchschool";

tweet.split(" ");
tweet.split(" ").reverse();
tweet.split(" ").reverse().join(" ");
```

Line 1 will split the string by every occurrence of whitespace and put each word into an array, `['Starting', etc...]`.

Line 2 will split the string as in line 1, but then it will reverse the array, `['#launchschool', etc...]`.

Line 3 will split into an array and then reverse the array and then it will join everything in the array together with a character of whitespace between them. The result will be the original string, just reversed.
