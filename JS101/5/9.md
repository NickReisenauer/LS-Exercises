## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array
- Output:
  key:value pair

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given array of strings,
  log key and how many appearances it made
  Case matters

- Mental Model:
  Using an object to store occurrences and then loop over logging out the key value pairs.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let vehicles = [
  "car",
  "car",
  "truck",
  "car",
  "SUV",
  "truck",
  "motorcycle",
  "motorcycle",
  "car",
  "truck",
];

countOccurrences(vehicles);

// console output -- your output sequence may be different
(car) => 4;
(truck) => 3;
(SUV) => 1;
(motorcycle) => 2;
```

## Data Structures

- Array
  Input
- Object
  Storing data
- String
  Output

## Algorithm

Loop over the array
Create an object that holds occurrences
For each element, check if in object
if it is, add += 1
otherwise initialize to 1
Console.log output

## Code

```js
const countOccurrences = (vehicles) => {
  const occurrences = {};
  vehicles.forEach((el) => {
    if (Object.keys(occurrences).includes(el)) {
      occurrences[el] += 1;
    } else occurrences[el] = 1;
  });

  for (let key in occurrences) {
    console.log(`${key} => ${occurrences[key]}`);
  }
};
```
