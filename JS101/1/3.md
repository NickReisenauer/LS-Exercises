# PEDAC

Log all even numbers from `1` to `99`, inclusive, to the console. Log all numbers on separate lines.

## Understand the Problem

- Input:
  No input required.

- Output:
  All even numbers between 1 to 99.

- Make the requirements explicit:
  Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

- Identify Rules
  1 and 99 are inclusive.
  Numbers should each be on their own line.
  Only even numbers should be logged.

- Mental Model:
  Loop over each number in the condition boundaries and if the current number is even, log it out.

## Examples / Test Cases

- Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14...

## Data Structure

- Numbers
- for Loops

## Algorithm

Using a `for` loop, we set the starting condition to `1` and stopping condition to `<= 99`.
Then we take our `i` index and determine if it is an odd or even number using the ternary operator.
If it is even, we log it to the console.

## Code

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 99; i += 1) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) console.log(i);
}
```
