## Understand the Problem

- Input:
  Number (greater than 1)

- Output:
  Number

- Rules / Requirements:
  Sum all numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 between 1 and x.
  x is inclusive
  Numbers are unique (not added more than once)

- Mental Model:
  Take all multiples of 3 and 5 between 1 and x and add them all up and return that number.

## Examples / Test Cases

multisum(3); // 3
multisum(5); // 8
multisum(10); // 33
multisum(1000); // 234168

## Data Structures

- Number
  Input

- Array
  Storing multiples

- If statement
  Check if the number is already in the array

- Reduce
  Add all the numbers in the array for the final result

- Number
  Output

## Algorithm

Take input, make two for loops.
First for loop is for multiples of 3 and add those to an array
Second for loop is multiples of 5, in this one, check if the number is already in the array.
Use reduce to output added total.

## Code

```js
const multisum = (x) => {
  const multiples = [];
  for (let i = 0; i >= x; i += 1) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) multiples.push(i);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i >= x; i += 1) {
    if (i % 5 === 0 && !multiples.includes(i)) multiples.push(i);
  }
  return multiples.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur);
};
```
