## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Two strings as arguments

- Output:
  One string, result of short string + long string + short string

- Rules and Requirements:
  Function takes two string arguments.
  Check for valid input?
  Determine the length of the strings.
  Empty string?
  ShortLongShort output
  Strings are of different lengths

- Mental Model:
  Take the two strings and compare their lengths, then whichever is shorter gets added to the front and the back.

## Examples / Test Cases

- Input: 'hi' 'there'
- Output: 'hitherehi'

- Input: ' ' 'code'
- Output: ' code '

## Data Structure

Input: 2 strings
Ternary operator for comparison
Variable to store longer value
Interpolated string for output

## Algorithm

Function takes 2 strings
Use ternary operator to compare 2 strings length
Store shorter string in variable
Interpolated string with defined pattern
Empty string edge case?

## Code

```js
const shortLongShort = (x, y) => {
  let shorter;
  let longer;
  x.length > y.length
    ? ((shorter = y), (longer = x))
    : ((shorter = x), (longer = y));
  return console.log(`${shorter}${longer}${shorter}`);
};
```
