## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Number greater than 0

- Output:
  Boolean

- Rules / Requirements:
  Leap years are divisible by 4 unless also divisible by 100
  If divisible by 100, has to also be evenly divisible by 400
  Input will be greater than 0
  Return true or false if it is or isn't a leap year

- Mental Model:
  Take the year input and determine through a series of checks if it's a leap year.

## Tests / Examples

isLeapYear(2016);  
isLeapYear(2015);  
isLeapYear(2100);  
isLeapYear(2400);  
isLeapYear(240000);  
isLeapYear(240001);  
isLeapYear(2000);  
isLeapYear(1900);  
isLeapYear(1752);  
isLeapYear(1700);  
isLeapYear(1);  
isLeapYear(100);  
isLeapYear(400);

## Data Structure

Input: Number
If statement: determining if leap year
Boolean: Storing if leap year or not
Output: Boolean

## Algorithm

Take user input
Perform initial check to see if divisible by 4.
If divisible by 4 check if divisible by 100.
If divisible by 4 and not 100 return true;
If divisible by 4 and 100 check if also divisible by 400
If yes to all return true, else false.

## Code

```js
const isLeapYear = (year) => {
  if (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) return true;
  if (year % 100 === 0 && year % 400 === 0) return true;
  return false;
};
```
