## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String (from readlineSync)
  String (number greater than 0)

- Output:
  String (with concatenated values)

- Requirements / Rules:
  User will enter a value greater than 0
  Ask the user whether to evaluate the sum or the product
  Starting at 1, either sum or product the numbers 1-userValue
  1 and user value are inclusive
  Turn readlineSync into number

- Mental Model:
  Ask the user what operation they'd like to perform and depending on that operation we can do 2 different math evaluations.

## Example / Test Cases

- Input: 7, product
- Output: 5040

- Input: 8, sum
- Output: 36

## Data Structure

Input: readlineSync string
Output: interpolated string
Math operations: number

## Algorithm

Ask user for number via readline.
Ask user for operation via readline.
Depending on type, perform math operation.
Math operation will be via for loop and a variable holding the current value.
Output string with correct operation type and values.
