# PEDAC

Log all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console. Log all numbers on separate lines.

## Understand the Problem

- Input:
  No input necessary.

- Output:
  Ddd numbers between 1-99 logged to the console.

- Explicit Requirements
  1 and 99 are inclusive.

- Identify Rules:
  All numbers should be on separate lines.
  Only log the odd numbers.

- Mental Model:
  Loop over and print out the odd numbers between the target values.

## Examples / Test Cases

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13...

## Data Structure

- Number

## Algorithm

Make a `for` loop with `1` as it's starting condition and `99` as it's stopping condition.
Inside of the for loop, check if the number is odd by using a remainder operator.
If it is odd, print it to the console.

## Code

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 99; i += 1) {
  if (i % 2 !== 0) console.log(i);
}
```
