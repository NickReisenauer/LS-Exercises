## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array of integers or strings

- Output:
  Array of integers or strings, sorted

- Rules / Requirements:
  We should mutate and return the original array "in-place".
  Compare left to right, if left is greater, swap the two, otherwise leave in place.
  Only stop iterating over when we can go through the whole array without making any swaps.
  We will be working with 'strings' and integers.
  The array will contain at least 2 elements.
  We will be working with positive values.

- Clarifying Questions:
  What happens if we are passed non integer or string values.
  What happens if we are not provided an array at all.
  What happens if we are provided with a negative integer.

## Examples / Test Cases

Simple Cases

```js
[5,4,6] -> [4,5,6]
['a','c','b'] -> ['a','b','c']
```

Edge / Error Cases

```js
[] -> []
[-1,-2] -> 'Error'
[true,false] -> 'Error'
```

## Data Structures

- Arrays
  - Integers
  - Strings
- Loops
- Conditionals
- State variable
- Reassignment operators

## Algorithm

Create a function that takes one array as its parameter.
Create a "state" variable to keep track of whether we have made any swaps.
Create a while loop to continue iteration while we are making swaps.
Inside the while loop, create a for loop to iterate over each element in the array.
Compare the left side to the right side.

## Code

```js
const bubbleSort = (arr) => {
  let swapped = true;
  while (true) {
    console.log(arr);
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        [arr[i], arr[i + 1]] = [arr[i + 1], arr[i]];
      } else {
        swapped = false;
      }
    }
    if (!swapped) break;
  }
};

let array2 = [6, 2, 7, 1, 4];
bubbleSort(array2);
```
