# PEDAC

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String
- Output:
  Array

- Rules / Requirements:
  Return all substrings in a given string
  Order by where in the string the substring begins
  Use the method we wrote in the previous exercise:

- Mental Model:
  Change my function from last time to use a results array and use a for loop to loop over inner and outer loops

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
substrings("abcde");

// returns
[
  "a",
  "ab",
  "abc",
  "abcd",
  "abcde",
  "b",
  "bc",
  "bcd",
  "bcde",
  "c",
  "cd",
  "cde",
  "d",
  "de",
  "e",
];
```

## Data Structures

- String
  Input
- Array
  Output

## Algorithm

first, we create a results array to hold our elements
the we split the string into an array with .split
then we map over it, and call leadingSubstrings function with str.slice(idx) so that it gets one less on each iteration
then we loop over the returned array with forEach and create another forEach inside to get each element
Inside our second nested forEach loop, we can push the current element to the results array
then we return our result array
