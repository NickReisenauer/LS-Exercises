## Understand the Problem

- Input:
  Array of integers

- Output:
  Sorted array of integers

- Rules / Requirements:
  Integers between 0-19
  Return new array of sorted by english word
  8 = 'eight' = e
  7 = 'seven' = s
  e > s
  Use lowercase english for the letter lookups.

- Mental Model:
  Create an object that contains the key-value pairs that we can reference when looping over the array.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
alphabeticNumberSort([
  0,
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6,
  7,
  8,
  9,
  10,
  11,
  12,
  13,
  14,
  15,
  16,
  17,
  18,
  19,
]);
// [8, 18, 11, 15, 5, 4, 14, 9, 19, 1, 7, 17, 6, 16, 10, 13, 3, 12, 2, 0]
```

## Data Structures

- Array of Integers
  Input
- Object: lookup table for english "number" spellings
- New array that has been sorted

## Algorithm

Create an object with the key equal to the number and the value equal to the number in english form.
Create a function that takes 1 array parameter.
Inside the function, create a copy of the array with array.slice().
On the copied array, call sort() and pass it the ((a,b) =>) callback function.
For a and b, access the lookup[a] or lookup[b] to compare the values.
The sort callback function should be lookup[a] - lookup[b].

## Code

```js
const lookup = {
  0: "zero",
  1: "one",
  2: "two",
  3: "three",
  4: "four",
  5: "five",
  6: "six",
  7: "seven",
  8: "eight",
  9: "nine",
  10: "ten",
  11: "eleven",
  12: "twelve",
  13: "thirteen",
  14: "fourteen",
  15: "fifteen",
  16: "sixteen",
  17: "seventeen",
  18: "eighteen",
  19: "nineteen",
};

const alphabeticNumberSort = (arr) => {
  let copy = arr.slice();
  copy.sort((a, b) => {
    if (lookup[a] > lookup[b]) return 1;
    else if (lookup[a] < lookup[b]) return -1;
    return 0;
  });
  return copy;
};
alphabeticNumberSort([
  0,
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6,
  7,
  8,
  9,
  10,
  11,
  12,
  13,
  14,
  15,
  16,
  17,
  18,
  19,
]);
```
