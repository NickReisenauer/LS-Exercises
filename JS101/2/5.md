## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  2 positive numbers

- Output:
  Result of two numbers

- Rules / Requirements:
  Two arguments, both positive integers.
  addition +, subtraction -, product \*, quotient /, remainder %, power \*\*
  No input validation
  Print each on a new line
  Input from readline

- Mental Model:
  Take the user's inputs from readline and then perform each equation in a console.log statement.

## Test Cases / Examples

==> Enter the first number:
23
==> Enter the second number:
17
==> 23 + 17 = 40
==> 23 - 17 = 6
==> 23 \* 17 = 391
==> 23 / 17 = 1
==> 23 % 17 = 6
==> 23 \*\* 17 = 141050039560662968926103

## Data Structures

- String
  Input, Output
- Operators

## Algorithm

Take user input, convert them to Numbers.
Write out a console.log statement for each operation.
Perform operation inside console.log (console.log(1 + 1))

## Code

```js

```
