## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array
- Output:
  Array

- Rules / Requirements:
  Returns every other element on the input as an array
  The values should be the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc...
  Empty returns an empty
  Valid user input
  Using index-based counting, its the 0,2,4,6 indexes
  If there's only one item, return whole item

- Mental Model:
  Take the array and loop over it, forming an array with the even indexed elements.

## Test Cases / Examples

console.log(oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); // logs [2, 4, 6]
console.log(oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); // logs [1, 3, 5]
console.log(oddities(["abc", "def"])); // logs ['abc']
console.log(oddities([123])); // logs [123]
console.log(oddities([])); // logs []

## Data Structures

- Array
  Input
- Filter
  Determine if index is 0 based
- Array
  Output

## Algorithm

Use filter to filter through the array.
Using the index provided by filter, we can determine if the index of the element is 0 based.
Return whatever comes back from filter

## Code

```js
const oddities = (arr) => arr.filter((item, index) => index % 2 === 0);
```
