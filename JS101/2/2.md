## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String (readline-sync)

- Output:
  String

- Rules / Requirements:
  Ask for users name
  Greet the user with their name
  If user types `!` at the end of their name, return `HELLO NAME, WHY ARE WE SCREAMING`.
  Assuming that input is a valid string
  Add check for length > 1

- Mental Model:
  Ask the user for their name and then greet them. If they add an exclamation point at the end of their name, then scream at them.

## Test Cases / Examples

What is your name? Bob
Hello Bob.

What is your name? Bob!
HELLO BOB. WHY ARE WE SCREAMING?

What is your name? !
Invalid Input

What is your name? ""
Invalid Input

What is your name? " "
Invalid Input

## Data Structures

- String
  readline-sync
- If statement
  check validity of name
- String.includes
  check if last index is exclamation

## Algorithm

Get user input via readline
Check if there's a string > 1 and it's not just an exclamation
Check if there's an exclamation and it's at the end.
If there is, return the yelling. else return regular greeting

## Code

```js

```
