## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array containing arrays of integers

- Output:
  Array containing arrays of integers

- Rules / Requirements:
  Takes X long and X number of arrays.
  Rotate clockwise by 90 degrees and return the result.
  Don't modify the original array.
  Assuming there will be at least 1 array containing at least 1 element.

- Clarifying Questions:
  Will the length of the sub-arrays always be the same.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let matrix1 = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

let matrix2 = [
  [3, 7, 4, 2],
  [5, 1, 0, 8],
];

console.log(newMatrix1); // [[3, 4, 1], [9, 7, 5], [6, 2, 8]]
console.log(newMatrix2); // [[5, 3], [1, 7], [0, 4], [8, 2]]
```

## Data Structures

- Array with sub-arrays
- Integers
- Loop / Map

## Algorithm

First, we need to figure out how many elements are in the sub-array.
However many elements are in the first array, that's how many sub-arrays will be in the rotated product.
We need to then create a loop to generate x amounts of empty sub-arrays in our `result` array.
Inside our above loop, we can create another loop, this loop will be able to access the x element we need from the nested-arrays that are provided to us.
We can then push to the first empty result sub-array and we want to push the given array sub-array `j` element `i`.

## Code

```js
const rotate90 = (arr) => {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr[0].length; i += 1) {
    result.push([]);
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j += 1) {
      result[i].push(arr[j][i]);
    }
  }
  return result.map((cur) => cur.reverse());
};
```
