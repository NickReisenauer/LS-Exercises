## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array with 3 arrays inside

- Output:
  Array with 3 array inside (transposed)

- Understanding the Problem:
  Given a nested array, transpose the elements in the array so that
  the first element in each array becomes the first array, the second
  element in each array is merged into the second array, etc...
  Don't modify the original array, but return a new array with the values moved around.

- Questions:
  Assuming the same structure / data type for each array and its entries.
  Assuming valid inputs.

## Examples / Test Cases

[[1, 4, 3], [5, 7, 9], [8, 2, 6]]

[[1, 5, 8], [4, 7, 2], [3, 9, 6]]

## Data Structures

- Array + nested arrays
  Input
- For loop
  Iteration through the nested arrays

## Algorithm

Create a function that takes in one argument (matrix).
The function should take the first index of each sub-array and create a sub-array of its own with the first elements.
Repeat the process for each sub-array and it's indexes.
To accomplish this, we can use a for loop that will access the sub arrays themselves,
inside the for loop, we can use another for loop to access each element in the sub array.

## Code

```js
const matrix = [
  [1, 4, 3],
  [5, 7, 9],
  [8, 2, 6],
];

const transpose = (matrix) => {
  let result = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i += 1) {
    result.push([]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i += 1) {
    for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j += 1) {
      result[i].push(matrix[j][i]);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

transpose(matrix);
```
