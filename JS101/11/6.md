## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array of integers or strings

- Output:
  Array of sorted integers or strings

- Rules / Requirements:
  Take an array, return a new array containing the values sorted.
  We need to sort by putting pairs of two if possible into a sub array.
  Then we put each element inside another array.
  Then we can slowly compare each element and either keep them in their position or swap them.
  We can use the function we wrote in the last problem to help us sort once we have arrays.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
// [9, 5, 7, 1]
// [[9, 5], [7, 1]]
// [[[9], [5]], [[7], [1]]]
// [[5, 9], [1, 7]]
// [1, 5, 7, 9]
```

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Nested arrays
- Integers
- Strings
- Sorting
- Sort function from last exercise

## Algorithm

Declare a function called `mergeSort` that takes one array as its argument.
We're going to use the function we created in the last exercise.
First, we need to check if the length of the array given is equal to length of 1, in which case we just return it.
Then we are going to split the array in half using slice.
We are then going to recursively call our function and pass in the half array we just created, and we keep doing that until the length is equal to 1, in which case we return.
Then we can just pass the two halves into our previous merge function and we have our sorted array.

## Code

```js
const merge = (arr1, arr2) => {
  const result = [];

  let duration = arr1.length + arr2.length;

  let leftCopy = [...arr1];
  let rightCopy = [...arr2];

  if (!arr1.length) return arr2;
  if (!arr2.length) return arr1;

  for (let i = 0; i < duration; i += 1) {
    if (!leftCopy[0] && rightCopy[0]) result.push(rightCopy.shift());
    else if (leftCopy[0] === rightCopy[0]) result.push(rightCopy.shift());
    else if (leftCopy[0] && !rightCopy[0]) result.push(leftCopy.shift());
    else if (leftCopy[0] > rightCopy[0]) result.push(rightCopy.shift());
    else result.push(leftCopy.shift());
  }

  return result;
};

const mergeSort = (arr) => {
  if (arr.length === 1) return arr;
  let leftHalf = arr.slice(0, arr.length / 2);
  let rightHalf = arr.slice(arr.length / 2);
  leftHalf = mergeSort(leftHalf);
  rightHalf = mergeSort(rightHalf);

  return merge(leftHalf, rightHalf);
};
```
