## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String

- Output:
  String, interpolated numbers

- Rules / Requirements:
  Take a string that contains numbers as strings ('eight')
  Return new string with numbers as strings replaced by numbers ('eight' => '8')
  Assuming letter numbers are lowercase 1-9 and there are no empty strings
- Mental Model:
  Create a lookup table and use map to iterate over and check for options to replace.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
wordToDigit("Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.");
// "Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks."
```

## Data Structures

- String
  Input
- Object
  Lookup table
- Map
  Creating new array
- Join
  Joining the mapped array

## Algorithm

Create an object with keys as letter numbers and values as digits.
Split the word into an array on each space.
Use map to loop over the array, on each map iteration,
check if the object contains the current value as a key, if it does,
add the numeric value instead of the current el,
otherwise, return el
Join with a space and return the new mapped array.

## Code

My Solution:

```js
const wordToDigit = (str) => {
  const lookup = {
    zero: 0,
    one: 1,
    two: 2,
    three: 3,
    four: 4,
    five: 5,
    six: 6,
    seven: 7,
    eight: 8,
    nine: 9,
  };
  return str
    .split(" ")
    .map((word) => {
      let fixedWord = "";
      let punctuation = "";
      word.split("").forEach((letter) => {
        if (letter >= "a" && letter <= "z") fixedWord += letter;
        else punctuation += letter;
      });
      if (Object.keys(lookup).includes(fixedWord))
        return lookup[fixedWord] + punctuation;
      return word;
    })
    .join(" ");
};
wordToDigit("Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.");
```

LS Solution:

```js
const NUM_WORDS = {
  zero: 0,
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  four: 4,
  five: 5,
  six: 6,
  seven: 7,
  eight: 8,
  nine: 9,
};

function wordToDigit(sentence) {
  Object.keys(NUM_WORDS).forEach((word) => {
    let regex = new RegExp(word, "g");
    sentence = sentence.replace(regex, NUM_WORDS[word]);
  });

  return sentence;
}
```
